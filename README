This projects aims to provide Quad-Buffer "emulation" for any OpenGL application.
As you may know OpenGL is able to do Quad-Buffer Stereo for many years.
But it only works with proffessionnal graphic cards, like Nvidia Quadro.

The goal of this project is to provide Quad-Buffer Stereo supports on non-Quad-buffered video cards.
It is designed for devellopers who wants to do Stereo application in OpenGL without having to support every display in the market !

As a developer you just need to make a Quad-Buffered Stereo application.
The users will have to install this OpenGL wrapper if they don't have a proffessionnal card.

* * COMPILATION * *

Compile the wrapper:
$ make

You can compile in debug mode:
$ make debug

* * USABILITY * *

How to use it :
$ LD_PRELOAD=/location/glQuadBufferEmu.so YourQuadBufferedApplication

Example of use:
$ LD_PRELOAD=./glQuadBufferEmu.so glxgears -stereo

You may want to make the lib available from any directory :
$ cp glQuadBufferEmu.so /usr/lib

Then you may use it just like that :
$ LD_PRELOAD=glQuadBufferEmu.so glxgears -stereo


* * CONFIGURATION * *

Sorry, the wrapper is hardcoded for now !

You can change the display mode in main.c. Search

/* The QuadBuffer emulator state */
QuadBufferState QBState =
{
    0,
    0,
    GL_FALSE,
    GL_FRONT,
    GL_FALSE,
    FRAMESEQUENTIAL, <= Hack here.
    {0, 0},
    {0, RED, CYAN, NULL, NULL},
    {VERTICAL},
    {{0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0}, SBS_SIDEBYSIDE},
    {0, NULL, NV3DVISION, NULL}
};

And choose your display mode.

Mode available:
- Monoscopic (Left or Right) [MONOSCOPIC],
- Anaglyph (any color) [ANAGLYPH],
- Side-by-side (Left/Right; Top/bottom; Frame-packing) [SIDEBYSIDE],
- Interlaced (is it really working ?) [INTERLACED],
- Frame-sequential (software page-flipping) [FRAMESEQUENTIAL].

Sub-modes cannot be choosen easily for now ...
